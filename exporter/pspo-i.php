So, if there was a question about who is responsible for failure or success of scrum work, the answer is the Scrum Team for sure. The Scrum Master of course needs to help the Product Owner in coaching the techniques for better backlog management, increasing the transparency of backlog, and more. So, the Scrum Master\u0026#39;s responsibility is to coach the team to adhere to Scrum and its principles. However, Scrum Master does not bear the primary responsibility for those items that are clearly owned by specific role. There are clearly defined responsibilities for each role as well. In this case, the question is - who is responsible for a specific activity of backlog management including its transparency. Following are the guidance from Scrum Guide as to this subject: ------ - The Product Owner is the sole person responsible for managing the Product Backlog. - Product Backlog management includes Ensuring that the Product Backlog is visible, transparent, and clear to all, and shows what the Scrum Team will work on next - The Product Owner is responsible for the Product Backlog, including its content, availability, and ordering - The Product Owner discusses the Product Backlog as it stands.

However, most either was later reflected in these measures, or they were circumstantial, explained in a number of indirect ways.\r\n\r\nTime to market consists of direct evidence of the software organization\'s ability to bring new features, functions, and products to the customers. Productivity was excluded, as speed is only one component of time to market; lean, focused functionality comes to market quicker than overburdened functionality developed with higher productivity.\r\n\r\nMuch of the software in the marketplace is encumbered. Despite being able to get it to the market rapidly, the customers may not want to implement it. They may have found that it was too hard to implement the last release, that much of the functionality was irrelevant to their needs, and that the overall product was flawed with unneeded functionality as well as hard to use because of defects. As this occurs to software, more and more of the software organization\'s budget is consumed maintaining the product, further reducing the funds available to innovate.",
