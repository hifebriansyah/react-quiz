(6, 2, 'What is Scrum?', 'Apa Itu Scrum?', 'Scrum is a container framework, with a focus on collaboration, within which people can address complex adaptive problems, while productively and creatively delivering products of the highest possible value. According to Scrum Guide, the Scrum is:\r\nLightweight,\r\nSimple to understand,\r\nDifficult to master\r\nScrum is founded on empirical process control theory, or empiricism. Empiricism asserts that knowledge comes from experience and making decisions based on what is known. Scrum employs an iterative, incremental approach to optimize predictability and control risk. Three pillars uphold every implementation of empirical process control: transparency, inspection, and adaptation.\r\n\r\nThe Scrum framework consists of Scrum Teams and their associated roles, events, artifacts, and rules. Each component within the framework serves a specific purpose and is essential to Scrum’s success and usage.\r\n\r\nBuilding a product using Scrum is a discovery process that starts with just enough preparation. Scrum is not a standardized process where you methodically follow a series of sequential steps that are guaranteed to produce, on time and on budget, a high-quality product that delights customers. Instead, Scrum is a framework for organizing and managing work. The Scrum framework is based on a set of values, principles, and practices that provide the foundation to which your organization will add its unique implementation of relevant engineering practices and your specific approaches for realizing the Scrum practices.', NULL, '2019-02-04 18:42:38', '2019-02-06 17:45:34'),
(7, 2, 'Empiricism', 'Empirisme', 'In an empirical process, information is gained by observation, rather than prediction. We also know empirical processes are best for complex problems, where there is more that we do not know than we do know. The two requirements in those situations, for an empirical process to work, are the following:\r\n\r\n1 - Inspection and adaptation: We must frequently inspect where we are so that we can adapt our next steps to optimize the results. The frequency of the inspection and adaptation depends on how much risk we want to take. The greater the unknown, the more quickly we can go off target. The more we go off target, the greater the waste to reorient us, undo the useless work, and start again. The events of Scrum set the frequency of the inspection and adaptation, where the artifacts contain the information to be inspected and adapted\r\n\r\nEVENT\r\nINSPECTION\r\nADAPTATION\r\nSprint Planning\r\nProduct Backlog\r\nCommitment Retrospective\r\nDefinition of Done\r\nSprint Backlog\r\nSprint Goal\r\nDaily Scrum\r\nSprint Goal\r\nSprint Progress\r\nSprint Backlog\r\nDaily plan\r\nSprint Review\r\nIncrement\r\nProduct Backlog\r\nProduct Backlog\r\nSprint Retrospective\r\nTeam and collaboration\r\nTechnology and engineering\r\nDefinition of Done \r\nActionable improvements\r\n These are the formal events that Scrum foresees as opportunities to inspect and adapt to the actual situation, so that the art of empiricism is performed no later than at the time of these events. This should not impede team members from improving and discussing improvements and progress whenever required. In a world of high dynamism that leads to using the Scrum framework it would be very strange if teams did not capitalize on new information and insights that improve their development life as soon as possible.\r\n\r\n2 - Transparency: When we make an inspection, we must be able to assess what we are seeing in the same terms as our goal. If our goal is to develop a system with some features and functionality, then we have to inspect something that is a feature, function, or a discrete subset of either. If we were using a predictive process, we would lay out the requirements for software that might take years to develop. But we know that with software, too much risk can accrue during such a long time period and too much waste is involved if we plan for a project of such long duration. Instead, we use a shorter frequency, typically 30 days or less. (We\'ll discuss later on the value of shorter frequency.) At the end of the first 30 days, we inspect the results and determine what we should do next to achieve our vision, adapting our course as necessary.\r\n\r\nEmpiricism helps people to navigate uncertain complex problems. It requires them to take one step at a time, such as performing a small amount of work to gather experience.\r\n\r\n1. It divides complex problems into a small scope of short-term iterations. For each iteration, just enough work is planned that can be completed within that short iteration of few weeks. There is no big scope of work spanning a long duration.\r\n\r\n2. It uses a small team to perform these few weeks of work. It requires them to increase the visibility of work or product information as they travel this iteration.\r\n\r\n3. The small team creates a product increment at the end of these few weeks. The Increment is shared with stakeholders for inspection and feedback is solicited. The team gathers experience from this work.\r\n\r\n4. From this feedback and experience, new clarity emerges and knowledge is obtained. The scope and plan for the next iteration is adjusted based on this new knowledge.', NULL, '2019-02-04 18:45:45', '2019-02-06 17:45:36'),
(8, 2, 'Self-organization', 'Organisasi mandiri', 'Scrum thrives on the daily collaboration of the three peer roles within a Scrum Team. Each role has clear accountabilities within the team as well as towards the organization. The Scrum Team and within it the Development Team are self-organizing units of people. Self-organization is not just the degree of freedom that is allowed. Self-organization is not about delegation, self-organization is, it happens.\r\n\r\nSelf-organization is not about enabling or empowerment, there is no higher authority that grants it. The ability to actually self-organize requires the removal of many existing barriers that prevent people from communicating, achieving insights and collaborating. There’s the role for external authority; facilitating teams by removing organizational or procedural barriers. Self-organization is not about anarchy or limitless freedom.\r\n\r\n Self-organization has and requires boundaries, boundaries within which self-organization happens. The Scrum rules are one of the primary boundaries within which a team organizes its own work:\r\n\r\n The Development Team collaboratively selects work that is ordered and expressed by the Product Owner, collaboratively creates actionable activities for their forecast and re-plans the work on a daily basis within a time-boxed Sprint to optimize the team’s output.\r\nThe Product Owner interacts with stakeholders and product management to identify the most valuable work, and relies on the cross-functional Development Team for the actual delivery of it in Increments of software product. Stakeholders help in shaping the future product at every Sprint Review.\r\nThe Scrum Master has no interest in scope, budget, delivery or tasks but coaches and facilitates the complete ecosystem in using Scrum to manage them.\r\nPeople organized in teams have the highest cohesion, deepest trust and most effective interconnections when the size of the team numbers around seven. Although Scrum sets the expectation of Development Team size between three and nine, there’s no formal process need to enforce this. Through self-organization a team will adjust its size autonomously until optimal performance is reached. This will even happen across multiple teams working together. There is no external body who knows how to organize work better than the people actually undertaking the work.\r\n\r\nHowever, autonomy and self-organization don’t resolve all problems. Some problems go beyond the self-organization of the Development Team. Scrum calls those ‘impediments’.\r\n\r\nThe general definition of an impediment is an ‘obstruction; hindrance; obstacle’. An impediment in Scrum is a factor that blocks the (Development) team in its creation of a valuable piece of software in a Sprint, or that restricts the team in achieving its intrinsic level of progress. It is the responsibility of the Scrum Master to remove impediments.\r\n\r\nThe Scrum concept of ‘impediments’ however is not a replacement for the traditional escalation procedures. An impediment is only an impediment if it indeed surpasses the self-organizing capabilities of the team, if it cannot be tackled within the self-organizing ecosystem.', NULL, '2019-02-04 18:45:45', '2019-02-06 17:45:38'),

Scrum is founded on empiricism and three pillars uphold every implementation of empiricism. Scrum events are built around these three pillars. If these pillars are properly followed, Scrum will be healthy. The three pillars of empiricism are: \r\n\r\n1 - Transparency: Transparency means:\r\n\r\n• Providing visibility of information about the work and the outcome.\r\n\r\n• Using common standards for information so that observers will share the common interpretation and understanding.\r\n\r\nBy transparency, the significant aspects of the work must be visible to those responsible for the outcome.\r\n\r\n2 - Inspection: performing frequent reviews of the Scrum artifacts and progress towards the Sprint Goal to get early feedback on undesirable variances.\r\n\r\n3 - Adaptation: performing adjustments if the inspection finds variance beyond acceptable limits, and hence the resulting product will be unacceptable. The Scrum Team has collective responsibility to make the adjustments as soon as possible to minimize further deviation.\r\n\r\nThe Scrum Team lives by Scrum Values so that the Scrum Pillars come to life Scrum values are a set of fundamental qualities underpinning the Scrum framework. Scrum Teams live by five values: commitment, courage, focus, openness, and respect. Being proficient in living these values brings the Scrum pillars of transparency, inspection, and adaptation to life and builds trust for everyone. The Scrum Team members learn and explore these values as they work with the Scrum events, roles, and artifacts. These values are seen as another checkpoint to compare the behavior within the Scrum Team to see if the behavior reflects the understanding or just the mechanics.\r\n\r\nThe five values of Scrum are:\r\n\r\n1. Commitment of every team member to achieve the goals of the Scrum Team. Commitment in following the pillars of empiricism and self-organization and using them to achieve the goals.\r\n\r\n2. Courage to work on tough problems. Courage to do the right thing by accepting that the future cannot be predicted and responding to emerging change. Courage helps everyone to be grounded in reality, not giving into personal pride.\r\n\r\n3. Focus of the team on prioritizing and completing the Sprint work to achieve the goals of the Scrum Team. Focus helps to avoid doing other things not related to the Sprint Goal.\r\n\r\n4. Openness of the Scrum Team and its stakeholders in expressing and facing the facts and truths about all the work and challenges with performing the work, thereby increasing transparency. Openness to collaborate\r\n\r\n5. Respect each other as capable and independent people so that it can provide a trustworthy environment to learn and share.', NULL, '2019-02-04 18:45:45', '2019-02-06 17:45:41'),

It is a framework within which one can employ various product building processes and techniques.  \r\n\r\nScrum is designed to help teams create and sustain complex software products in turbulent circumstances via self-organization. Scrum implements the scientific method of empiricism to better deal with the complexity and unpredictability of software development. The content of the Scrum framework has been consciously limited to a bare minimal set of mandatory elements so that each element becomes essential. Breaking Scrum’s base design by leaving out one or more elements is likely to cover up problems, instead of revealing them.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of empiricism via Scrum is to help people perform inspections & adaptations upon the transparency of the work being undertaken. Scrum builds in frequent reality checks to assure best possible decisions. Scrum helps to adjust, adapt, change and gain flexibility. Scrum, through its minimalistic design, has no exhaustive and formal prescriptions on how to design and plan the behaviour of all software development actors, nor does it lay out their expected behaviour against time in designs and plans, let alone how these designs and plans must be documented, maintained and stored. Scrum has no rules for up- front predictions of document types and deliverables to be produced. Neither does Scrum instruct the exact time of their production. Instead of installing, thriving and relying on handovers, toll gates and control meetings, Scrum de-installs them as a major source of delays, waste and disrespect.', NULL, '2019-02-04 18:45:45', '2019-02-06 17:45:44'),
